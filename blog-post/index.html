            HTML is a staple for all web application developers, its most important function is the use of HTML tags which can be used to connect to other pages.
            You can use what is called a hyperlink or hypertext to connect to any other page on the internet, <a href="https://www.educba.com/uses-of-html/" target="_blank">like so</a>.
            With this ability users can quite easily navigate from one webpage to the next.
            There is a universal layout for web pages that all developers use that consists of the title, head, and body of a webpage, which developers can create using the specified tags in HTML.
            It is also possible for a developer to place images on their webpages using the img tag.<img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/a2DRuCliClU/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="img tag"/>
        </p>
        <p>
            With the srcset attribute of img element a developer can change how an image is rendered for the user, changing the size and many other elements of the picture. Client-side storage is now possible
            with HTML5 using localStorage and IndexDB. Data can also be saved even when a user is disconnected by using a cache system for a particular application. Data entry can be presented on webpages
            using HTML tags to make tables. HTML5 also has special API's for game development, file system, geolocation, and plethora of other functionalities. HTML has become common among the web-developer world and will continue
            to assist in the creation of future web-applications.

            Today I learned 5 new reasons for a person to learn HTML and CSS. For starters being able to build websites is a benefitfor any business no matter the industry. From car dealerships to private government contractors
            having an informative website can benefit everyone. If a person specializes as a web-developer they will have plenty of jobs to choose from and if they would rather work for themsevles they can post their information on a website
            to be contracted by any company or individual out there. But there is more to it than simply knowing how to code in HTML a person must also be creative enough to create eye-catching material on their websites in order to grasp the
            users attention. Luckily HTML is not that hard of a skill to learn the average person can find a tutorial online and commit just a few hours a week to the craft. Both HTML and CSS offer simple sets of rules for a person to follow and
            soon they will be well on their way to being an all-star web-developer. Also after learning HTML and CSS it will make it easier to transition to other languages like JavaScript, Python, PHP ,and SQL.
