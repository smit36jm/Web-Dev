            HTML is a staple for all web application developers, its most important function is the use of HTML tags which can be used to connect to other pages.
            You can use what is called a hyperlink or hypertext to connect to any other page on the internet, <a href="https://www.educba.com/uses-of-html/" target="_blank">like so</a>.
            With this ability users can quite easily navigate from one webpage to the next.
            There is a universal layout for web pages that all developers use that consists of the title, head, and body of a webpage, which developers can create using the specified tags in HTML.
            It is also possible for a developer to place images on their webpages using the img tag.<img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/a2DRuCliClU/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="img tag"/>
        </p>
        <p>
            With the srcset attribute of img element a developer can change how an image is rendered for the user, changing the size and many other elements of the picture. Client-side storage is now possible
            with HTML5 using localStorage and IndexDB. Data can also be saved even when a user is disconnected by using a cache system for a particular application.
