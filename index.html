            If I had to teach a web-dev course I would slowly expose the students to html, JavaScript, and css. I would probably spend a considerable amount of time on teaching the students how to properly format a website before moving on to anything else. After they have somewhat mastered the basics I would then show them how using react simplfies the process of creating a web application by eliminating the need for some of the previous tools earned in javascript and basic html coding. I think having clear examples of what you are trying to accomplish is the most beneficial aide in learning the material in this course.
